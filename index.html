		<h2>Rabbiters Investigation File</h2>
		<p>Case Number: RBT001</p>
		<p>Case Name: Sanjay Roy Rape and Murder Case</p>
		<p>Investigation Team: Rabbiters</p>
		
		<h3>Summary of Events</h3>
		
		<p>Sanjay Roy, a 33-year-old civic volunteer with the Kolkata Police, was arrested in connection with the rape and murder case.</p>
		
		<h3>Sequence of Events</h3>
		
		<ul>
			<li>The victim doctor and her four colleagues ordered online food and had dinner in the seminar room. They were watching ace athlete Neeraj Chopra win silver medal.</li>
			<li>After midnight, the victim doctor remained in the seminar room to rest while her colleagues left.</li>
			<li>CCTV footage of the hospital premises showed that Roy entered the building around 4 am on Friday, wearing a bluetooth device around his neck.</li>
			<li>When he left the building 40 minutes later, the Bluetooth device was no longer visible.</li>
			<li>Investigations showed that he had left the device near the scene of the crime, which might act as the primary piece of evidence against him.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h3>Arrest and Investigation</h3>
		
		<p>Following his arrest, the cops also found that Roy had consumed alcohol before the crime took place. Sources close to the investigation revealed that Roy had gone behind the hospital around 11 pm and drank alcohol, adding that he used to watch porn while drinking there.</p>
		
		<p>A crucial piece of evidence—a broken wire from a Bluetooth earphone—was discovered near the victim’s body in a fourth-floor seminar room. This clue played a pivotal role in leading to Roy’s capture.</p>
		
		<p>After committing the crime, Roy returned to his residence, slept, and then attempted to destroy evidence by washing his clothes the next morning. However, the police discovered bloodstains on his shoes during a search.</p>
		
		<p>Roy will remain under police custody until August 23.</p>
		
		<h3>Personal Life</h3>
		
		<p>Sanjay Roy was married four times, with three of his previous wives leaving him because of “misconduct”. His fourth wife died of cancer last year. His neighbours added that Roy used to often return home late at night in an inebriated state.</p>
		
		<p>One of his wives’ mothers reportedly told that Roy was violent towards women. “After he married my daughter by hiding his previous marriage, we came to know several things against Sanjay. We even filed a police complaint against him for beating and torturing my daughter.”</p>
		
		<h3>Social Media Accounts</h3>
		
		<p>Sanjay Roy, the accused in the Kolkata doctor rape and murder case, does not have any publicly available social media accounts. The search results only provide news articles and reports about the case, but no social media profiles or accounts associated with Sanjay Roy.</p>
